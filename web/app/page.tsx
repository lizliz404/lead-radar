              <pre>{`# Weekly Demand Scan: Shopify inventory forecasting

## Market summary
Scanned public Reddit-style conversations across Shopify and ecommerce communities. The strongest demand signal is not “inventory management” broadly — it is cash-flow stress caused by manual reorder planning.

## Ranked evidence
1. [Buying intent: High] [Review: pending]
   “I’d pay for something that tells me when to reorder based on velocity.”

2. [Pain: High] [Review: pending]
   Spreadsheet forecasting breaks whenever lead times change during Q4.

## Next action
Interview merchants doing $500k–$3M/year who still plan replenishment in Sheets.

## Limitation
This sample illustrates report shape. Real reports must include source links and review status.`}</pre>
